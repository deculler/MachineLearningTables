# MachineLearningTables
Development of a companion to "An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R" by James, Witten, Hastie, and Tibshirani
using a derivative of [datascience/Tables](http://data8.org/datascience/tables.html) that provides the R functionality used in the
book.

The subclass of Tables, [ML_Table](https://github.com/deculler/MachineLearningTables/edit/master/ml_table.py) builds upon the
Table dataframe to provide a broad set of statistical inference and machine learning in the python, scipy environment.
